A [hello world]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world) program is usually the first program a developer makes when either learning to program or testing out a new language or framework.  I have been playing with computers since I was 3 and developing software since I was 6 so I’ve written many Hello World programs over the years that I’m not going to try and recount count them. 

This is my “Hello World” blog post because it is the first entry in my new blog. As a Web Application Developer, consultant, and serial “Wannapreneur” (repeatedly failed entrepreneur) this first post is guaranteed not be the last, first blog post I write.

I’m a Web Application Developer living in Herndon, Virginia whose primary focus is front end development and user experience.  I’m an experienced JavaScript developer and work with the [Mootools](http://www.mootools.net) and [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) libraries. I hold my own on the backend in many different languages such as PHP, Ruby, .NET, and Python and I have experience using SQL and NoSQL databases.

I'm a graduate of [The Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu) with a degree in [Computer Engineering](http://www.cse.psu.edu). At Penn State I developed energy monitoring hardware and software, a website, and communications materials for a [solar powered home](http://solar.psu.edu/2007/default.aspx?lang=en). I gained experience in the manufacturing industry doing robotics PLC programming and manufacturing data processing on two separate 9 month Co-Ops with [R.A. Jones](http://www.rajones.com) and [Sony](http://www.sony.com).

Now I work full time for a non-profit environmental company as an internal software developer. I also moonlight as a consultant at [SweetRadish](http://www.sweetradish.com).

Woot! First Post! (Obligatory)
