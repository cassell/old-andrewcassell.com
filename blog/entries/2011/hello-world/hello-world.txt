A [hello world]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world) program is usually the first program a developer makes when either first learning to program or testing out a new language or framework. This is my "Hello World" blog post because it is the first entry in my new blog. 

I amm a Web Application Developer living in Herndon, Virginia whose primary focus is front-end development and user experience.  I'm an experienced JavaScript developer and hold my own on the backend in many different languages such as PHP, Ruby, .NET, Python, and JavaScript (Node.js). I have experience using SQL and NoSQL databases.

I'm a graduate of [The Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu) with a degree in [Computer Engineering](http://www.cse.psu.edu). At Penn State I developed household energy monitoring hardware and software, a website, and communications materials for a [solar powered home](http://solar.psu.edu/2007/default.aspx?lang=en). I gained experience in the manufacturing industry doing robotics PLC programming, manufacturing data processing, and software development on two separate 9 month Co-Ops with [R.A. Jones](http://www.rajones.com) and [Sony](http://www.sony.com).

Woot! First Post! (Obligatory)
