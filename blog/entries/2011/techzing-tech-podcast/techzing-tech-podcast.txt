138 episodes can't be wrong. [Jason Roberts](http://www.codusoperandi.com) and [Justin Vincent](http://www.justinvincent.com) are the hosts of the [TechZing tech podcast](http://www.techzinglive.com), one of my favorite podcasts to listen to.

Jason and Justin interview guests with a genuine interest to learn, and by listening and taking notes I have learned a ton along with them. The guests they select are an excellent sampling of experts in the startup field and offer a great amount collective wisdom.

Jason and Justin are both in the midst of doing their own startups, and because I am attempting to do the same (on nights and weekends), many of the questions they ask are the same questions I would have for those guests. Some of my favorites have been (alphabetical order): James Altucher, Jeff Atwood, John C Dvorak, Ruben Gamez, Patrick McKenzie, Rob Walling, Andrew Warner, and Gabriel Weinberg. 

Not only do they interview guests but they also have a weekly discussion show. Jason and Justin discuss topics from previous interviews, give their unique perspectives on the topics, and give real examples of how they have worked (or not) for them in their startups.  They also give their viewpoints on a wide range of topics from Hacker News and the world of tech in general.
