You can now host an entire website on Amazon S3.

I wrote a publishing script that generates static .html files from PHP files and then uploads those to Amazon S3. 

Hosting .html files (instead of PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. connected to a database backend) means your hosting options are practically limitless, hosting is nearly free for sites that generate small quantities of traffic (this site costs me about 2 cents a month),  and sites that generate a lot of traffic can scale almost infinitely.

See this blog entry on the Amazon Web Services Blog for more information on storing HTML files on Amazon S3.
