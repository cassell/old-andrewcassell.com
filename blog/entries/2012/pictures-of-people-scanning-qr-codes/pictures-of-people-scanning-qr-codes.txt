2D Barcodes are incredibly useful. QR codes used in marketing purposes are an entirely different story.

Recently [Artur Kim](http://arturkim.com/) created a Tumblr blog entitled ['Pictures of People Scanning QR-codes'](http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com/).

It's very apt.

It is in the spirit of his blog that I am providing you a QR code that will take you to that page:

![Pictures of People Scanning QR-codes](http://static.andrewcassell.com/blog/2012/pictures-of-people-scanning-qr-codes/pictures-of-people-scanning-qr-codes-qr-code.png "Pictures of People Scanning QR-codes")

The internet will not have justice until someone posts a picture of them scanning this QR code.
